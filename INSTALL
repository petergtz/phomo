Make sure all dependencies from the file DEPENDENCIES are met.

Also make sure, your gcc version works fine with your boost version.
E.g. boost 1.40 should be used with gcc 4.3, otherwise there might 
be some build problems.

Then, from a console, execute:

    make
    
And optionally:

    make install
    
To uninstall:

    make uninstall
